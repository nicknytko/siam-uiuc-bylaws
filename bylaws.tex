\maketitle
This Rules of Procedure (hereinafter called ``Rules'') apply to the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (``SIAM'') Student Chapter, named the ``University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign Chapter of Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics''.  Hereinafter, ``SIAM'' or ``Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics'' will refer to the parent organization, while ``the Chapter'' will refer to the student chapter/organization.

The Chapter to which these Rules apply is formed by the Society for Industrial and Applied
Mathematics and shall operate within the Bylaws of the parent organization. The SIAM bylaws
specify how Chapters are formed; see the SIAM bylaws for details. The Chapter shall not affiliate
with any other organization without first obtaining the written approval of SIAM. Provisions for
SIAM  Student (University) Chapters are contained in the SIAM Bylaws and are included in these

\article{Membership}
\section{Elegibility}
Any person engaged or interested in mathematics or computing and their applications
shall be eligible for membership in this Chapter. Chapter membership may be interdisciplinary,
with members from multiple departments.

All members of the Chapter who are not already affiliated with the parent organization shall be
encouraged to become regular or student members of SIAM.

\section{Member classes}

fees to cover the expenses of special activities, such as social activities and trips to labs, but the
collection of fees is to be avoided, whenever possible.

\section{SIAM membership}
Chapter members shall have the privileges of SIAM membership only if they are regular
or student members of SIAM.

\section{SIAM student membership}
All members of the Chapter who are students enrolled in the sponsoring institution are
eligible for free student memberships in SIAM. The Chapter is responsible for providing a list of its
student members to SIAM so that complimentary student membership in SIAM can be processed.

Termination of student membership shall take place upon graduation or withdrawal
from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
%
\article{Sponsorship}
The executive committee of the chapter shall appoint a Faculty Advisor for the Chapter.  The Advisor must be a member in good standing with SIAM. In the event said Advisor relinquishes his/her position, the Sponsor shall appoint a new Advisor.  The responsibilities, rights and duties of the Faculty Advisor shall be those normally assigned to the Faculty Advisor of student organizations of the Sponsor, but in addition, the Faculty Advisor is expected to take leading role in the development of the Chapter activities consistent with the objectives of SIAM.
%
\article{Officers}
The Chapter shall have a President, a Vice-President, a Secretary and a Treasurer. Officers shall be chosen from Student Members of the Chapter and must  be Student Members in good standing with SIAM.

\section{President}
The President shall preside at the meetings of the Chapter (and the Chapter Executive Committee (see Article VII below)).  In the absence of the President, the Vice-President shall assume the duties of the President.  In the absence of the latter, the Secretary shall assume said duties.

\section{Secretary}
The Secretary shall keep a record of the affairs of the Chapter, handle correspondence, and submit an annual report of Chapter activities to the Secretary of SIAM, which report shall be suitable for publication in SIAM News or its equivalent.

\section{Treasurer}
The Treasurer shall receive and take custody of Chapter funds, and shall submit an annual Treasurer's Report and other financial reports, as requested, to the Treasurer of SIAM.  The annual Treasurer's Report shall be prepared as of the end of the academic year and shall be transmitted to the Treasurer of SIAM by no later than 30 days following the end of the academic year.

\section{Officer Elections}
Officer elections shall be held at a regularly scheduled meeting before the end of the
Spring Semester. The date of the election shall be announced to all members no less than thirty
days in advance. Early voting and voting by proxy may be permissible, given that appropriate
steps to ensure accountability are taken.

Nominations for officer candidates shall be finalized no less than one week prior to the vote. The
Chapter Secretary shall be responsible to verify all nominations are in compliance with the terms
in Section 1.

The election shall be held by secret ballot prepared by the Chapter Secretary in advance. The

shall be open and may be observed by any Chapter member.

but no position shall be held by the same individual more than two consecutive years.

In the event that an officer vacates their position early, an election shall be held at the next
scheduled meeting to select an immediate replacement. Any of the current officers may elect to
run for the newly opened position. In the event that an officer is to fill the vacant seat, another
election must be held to fill that officerâ€™s newly vacated seat. Time served in a vacated position
shall not count toward the maximum term limit.

\article{Executive Committee}
\section{Committee members}
The Chapter shall be managed by an Executive Committee consisting of the incumbent
officers and a single member appointed by the Faculty Advisor. Any active student member of the
Chapter may be appointed to this position, provided they are not currently serving as an officer.

three consecutive terms.

The Executive Committee is charged with making policy decisions for the Chapter. The Chapter
President shall chair the Executive Committee, and the Chapter Secretary shall keep records of
meetings and decisions made by the Executive Committee.

\section{Vacant seats}
Should a seat in the Executive Committee be vacated prematurely by one of the officers,
it shall be filled following the rules in Article VI, Section 6. If the Advisor-appointed member steps down, the Advisor shall appoint a new member to the committee to serve the remainder of the term. Time served in a vacated position shall not count toward the maximum term limit.

\article{Other Committees}
To provide the Chapter with flexibility to adapt, the Executive Committee may easily
create and dissolve committees, with the exception of itself. The official creation of a committee
may be done by the President, Vice-President, or by a majority vote by the Executive Committee.
The official dispersement of a committee requires majority agreement in the Executive Committee.

A committee may be organized in whatever way is deemed best to achieve its goals. The Executive
Committee may  appoint individuals to positions in a committee.

Examples of possible committees include:
